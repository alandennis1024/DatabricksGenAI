## 1. Objectives

### Business Objectives

State the strategic or operational goals driving the project.

**Examples:**
- Improve customer support through a GenAI-powered assistant.
- Automate internal knowledge access via conversational search.
- Accelerate report generation and data interpretation.

### Technical Objectives

Define specific, measurable AI-related goals.

**Examples:**
- Develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system.
- Achieve < 2-second latency for user queries.
- Integrate secure model serving into existing Databricks pipelines.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

- Curate and prepare training and knowledge data using Unity Catalog.
- Embed data using pre-trained embedding models and Databricks Vector Search.
- Implement GenAI model using APIs (OpenAI, MosaicML, etc.) or fine-tuned LLMs.
- Serve models with Databricks Model Serving.
- Log model inputs, outputs, and user feedback with MLflow.
- Enforce governance and access control using Unity Catalog and IAM.
- Evaluate model quality and user satisfaction.

### Out of Scope

- Production-scale monitoring pipelines (future phase).
- Fine-tuning LLMs from scratch on proprietary infrastructure.
- Integration with downstream business systems (ERP, CRM).

## 3. Approach

### 3.1 Methodology

- Agile delivery with iterative model development and evaluation.
- Human-centered design to ensure alignment with user expectations.
- Incorporate prompt engineering and feedback loops early and often.

### 3.2 Databricks Services to Be Used

| Databricks Service              | Purpose                                                             |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unity Catalog                  | Data discovery, access control, governance                          |
| Delta Lake                     | Store and manage structured/unstructured data with ACID transactions |
| Databricks Vector Search       | Semantic search over embedded documents or data                     |
| Model Serving                  | Real-time serving of LLMs and other generative models               |
| MLflow                         | Track experiments, log prompts/outputs, register models             |
| Databricks Notebooks           | Rapid development, prototyping, and testing of GenAI workflows      |
| Lakehouse AI                   | Framework for unifying LLMs with lakehouse data                     |
| Databricks Workflows           | Schedule and automate data/model pipelines                          |
| Inference Tables (Preview)     | Log and analyze model inference across prompts and outputs          |

### 3.3 Phased Approach

- **Phase 1: Discovery** – Define personas, use cases, data sources
- **Phase 2: Design** – Build prompts, design RAG pipeline, select models
- **Phase 3: Build** – Data prep, embeddings, vector search, model integration
- **Phase 4: Evaluate** – User testing, model performance, prompt tuning
- **Phase 5: Deliver** – Deploy with Model Serving, log inferences with MLflow

### 3.4 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                          | Target/Threshold                  |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Response latency                | < 2 seconds                       |
| Answer accuracy (manual review)| > 85%                             |
| User satisfaction score         | > 4.0/5                           |
| Feedback integration time       | < 2 sprint cycles                 |
| Model hallucination rate        | < 10%                             |
