This document outlines instructions for the Gemini agent.

== File Placement

All AsciiDoc (`.asciidoc`) and Markdown (`.md`) files, except for `README.md` files that are useful for GitHub repositories, should be placed in appropriate `docs` folders.

== Python Best Practices

Ensure that all Python code adheres to best practices, including:

*   **Docstrings:** All modules, classes, methods, and functions must include comprehensive docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
*   **Type Hints:** Use type hints for function arguments and return values to improve code readability and maintainability.
